Homework 2

This program will use a command line interface in the terminal to take user input and
it will run from the TopSecret class

If the user runs the TopSecret class from the command line with no arguments (e.g. java
topsecret), the program will print out a list of the files in the library available for
display

If the user runs it with a number as an argument (e.g. java topsecret 01), the program will
display the contents of the matching file

Finally, the command line will look for a second argument to determine if an alternate key
should be used in deciphering the file

The program will use JUnit for testing as well as Mockito in the test files
