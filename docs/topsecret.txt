Documentation for TopSecret class

TopSecret class combines the user and command line interface, file handler, program control, and cipher together.
The program will look at args given to decide whether to list available files (0 args), decipher and return contents of specified file (1 arg), or decipher using alternate cipher and return contents of specified file (2 args).
It reads the inputs given by the user through the command line interface and program control will use what command line interface provides to find and read files through file handler.
Then, depending on the args given by the user, cipher will use cipher key specified to give the user the deciphered contents of the specified text file.
