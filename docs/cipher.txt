Ciphering Feature
2/4/26
Joshua Yoo

This program entry point will be the Main class.

This program takes no command-line arguments.

This program accepts a ciphered string and outputs the deciphered
version of that string using a cipher key stored in an external file.

The cipher key is stored in a file named "key.txt" inside the
"ciphers" directory, located at the root of the project. The cipher
file contains exactly two lines:
- Line 1: the actual (decoded) characters
- Line 2: the corresponding cipher characters

Each character in the first line maps directly to the character in
the same position on the second line.

Before deciphering, the cipher must be validated. The cipher is valid
only if:
- Both lines exist
- Both lines are the same length
- No duplicate characters appear in either line

If the cipher is invalid, the program prints an error message and
terminates.

Once validated, the program reads a ciphered string, replaces each
cipher character with its matching actual character, and prints the
decoded result. Characters not found in the cipher are printed
unchanged.

Pseudocode

load cipher file "ciphers/key.txt"

read first line as actualCharacters
read second line as cipherCharacters

if actualCharacters length != cipherCharacters length
    print error and exit

if actualCharacters contains duplicate characters
    print error and exit

if cipherCharacters contains duplicate characters
    print error and exit

print "Cipher Key"
print actualCharacters
print cipherCharacters
print blank line

prompt user for original text
read originalText

print "Original"
print originalText
print blank line

create empty string cipheredText

for each character c in originalText
    if c exists in actualCharacters
        find index i of c in actualCharacters
        append cipherCharacters[i] to cipheredText
    else
        append c to cipheredText

print "Ciphered text"
print cipheredText
print blank line

create empty string decipheredText

for each character c in cipheredText
    if c exists in cipherCharacters
        find index i of c in cipherCharacters
        append actualCharacters[i] to decipheredText
    else
        append c to decipheredText

print "Deciphered text"
print decipheredText



Tests
Given key.txt:
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
bcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyza

Original input:
dog

Expected output:

Cipher Key
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
bcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyza

Original
dog

Ciphered text
eph

Deciphered text
dog


cipher("dog") should return eph
decipher("eph") should return dog

cipher("xyz") should return yza
decipher("yza") should return xyz

cipher("a-b!") should return b-c!
decipher("b-c!") should return a-b!

validateCipher() should return true for valid, same-length keys
validateCipher() should return false if duplicate characters exist
validateCipher() should return false if key lengths do not match
